# The Omitted Role of Trade in Critical Mineral Sufficiency and Circularity Potential

Folders:

* **Functions**: Define common user-built functions used throughout the model.
* **Load Data**: Scripts to load and process original data sources for the demand model.
* **Figures Inputs**: Scripts to generate Figures for the main data inputs of the model.
* **Mineral Demand Model**: Function to run the dynamic material flow analysis to estimate mineral demand, and several scripts to run sensitivity scenarios.

Scripts:
