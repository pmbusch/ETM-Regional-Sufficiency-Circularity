# The Omitted Role of Trade in Critical Mineral Sufficiency and Circularity Potential

All scripts are numbered in order (suggested) to run to replicate full results. 

Please note that some data is proprietary. In those cases the raw data is not included here, but a processed input used for the Demand Model is included.

The most important script is **RunMineralDemand.R**, which defines the function to conduct the dynamic material flow analysis (dMFA). Other scripts use this function using different inputs as sensitivity analysis.

For details on all Data Inputs, please check Folder 'Load_Data'.
